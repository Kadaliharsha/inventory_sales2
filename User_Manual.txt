Step 1: Define Your Menu Structure
Decide the main actions your program should provide.
For example:

Manage Products
Manage Customers
Process Sales
Generate Bills
Export/Import CSV
Exit
Step 2: Write a Loop for the Main Menu
Use a loop (usually while True: in Python) to continuously display the menu until the user chooses to exit.

Example:

Python
while True:
    print("1. Manage Products")
    print("2. Manage Customers")
    print("3. Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
    # Handle the choice here
Step 3: Parse and Handle User Input
After capturing the choice, use conditional statements (if/elif/else) to call different functions or sub-menus.

Example:

Python
if choice == "1":
    product_menu()
elif choice == "2":
    customer_menu()
elif choice == "3":
    print("Exiting...")
    break
else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
Step 4: Implement Sub-Menus (If Needed)
Each sub-menu can have its own loop for navigation.
For example, inside product_menu():

Python
def product_menu():
    while True:
        print("1. Add Product")
        print("2. View Products")
        print("3. Back to Main Menu")
        sub_choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
        if sub_choice == "1":
            add_product()
        elif sub_choice == "2":
            view_products()
        elif sub_choice == "3":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice.")
Step 5: Implement the Action Functions
Write the actual functions like add_product(), view_products(), etc., which perform the logic for each option.

Step 6: Start the Program with the Main Menu
Make sure your main menu loop runs when the script is executed.

Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_menu()
Step 7: Test Navigation
Run your program and try different paths through the menu to be sure navigation works as expected.

Summary:

Plan and list menu options
Use a loop to display the menu and get user input
Use conditionals to handle choices
Use sub-menus for complex branches
Implement the logic for each action
Make sure the main menu runs at script start
Test thoroughly
